# Magic_8_Ball
Creating a magic 8 ball on python

With the help of this code, a Magic 8 Ball program, the user can ask a question and get a random response. Three categoriesâ€”positive, neutral, and negative, are used to categorize the responses. Additional capabilities of the code include seeing, deleting, counting, and searching the archive of earlier questions and responses. The code uses the random and os libraries to handle file operations and choose replies at random. Based on the input from the user, the main loop calls the appropriate functions. A history.txt file keeps track of all the queries and responses.

My big breakthrough moment was when I was trying to figure out what library to use and how to use it to be able to store the history and access it with the most integrable techniques. I then discovered it was the history.txt file.
